Welcome to the **I**ntelligent **T**ransportation **S**ystem **Sec**urity (**ITSSec**) Group website! 

Our group is dedicated to conducting in-depth research in the field of intelligent traffic security, focusing on the following areas:

- **Safety Testing**: testing and evaluation for autonomous driving algorithms, modules, and systems.
- **Data Augmentation**: image or video generation, especially focus on generative data augmentation (GDA) in autonomous driving scenarios.
- **CPS/IoT Security**: attacks and defenses against the physical world, sensors, algorithms and automonous driving systems.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: safety reinforcement learning (SRL), robustness reinforcement learning and offline reinforcement learning for autonomous driving systems.
